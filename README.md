# Nepal Earthquake Building Damage Analysis

This repository contains a **Dash-based interactive dashboard** for analyzing building damage caused by the 2015 Nepal earthquake. The dashboard allows for **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, visualization of building features, and evaluation of **machine learning models** predicting severe damage.
